# First Nations Activists Dataset

## ⚠️ Important Cultural Notice

**This dataset contains names, images, and biographical information of deceased Indigenous persons.**

In keeping with Indigenous cultural protocols and values, we acknowledge that:
- Many Indigenous communities have specific cultural practices regarding the sharing of information about deceased persons
- Some communities may prefer that names, images, or stories of deceased ancestors not be shared publicly
- Each Indigenous culture has unique protocols around honoring and remembering those who have passed on

**If you are using this dataset and have concerns about cultural appropriateness or specific protocols that should be observed, please contact us immediately.**

Every effort has been made to present these individuals with dignity and respect, focusing on their public contributions to Indigenous rights and environmental justice. However, technical datasets cannot fully capture the cultural significance and protocols surrounding Indigenous knowledge keepers and activists.
